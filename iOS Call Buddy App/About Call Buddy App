The iOS Call Buddy app is designed to simulate incoming and outgoing phone calls on an iOS device using Apple's CallKit framework. 
This app allows users to experience and test call functionalities without needing an actual phone call. By leveraging CallKit, 
the Call Buddy app can create realistic call scenarios, helping developers and testers to validate call-related features in their applications. 
This is particularly useful for developing and debugging apps that rely on telephony services, ensuring they work seamlessly in real-world situations.
